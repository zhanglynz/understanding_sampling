I guess that many different answers will come out, because we are all different in many aspects, such as culture background, knowledge level, and learning style etc. etc.. For myself, if I want to seriously learn some complex stuff, then I will write about it. Without doubts, Sampling is complex, and it is kind of boring, but it is important (for me, because I need it for my work, and for you the reasons must be different). So, I have to learn and re-learn sampling, and now I am writing about it. Since I live and work in New Zealand, I will use contexts and examples at there. Chapter 1 introduces preliminary concepts, such as population, target population, survey populaton, simple random sample, stratified sample, cluster sample, and systematic sample. Chapter 1 also presents some knowledge about New Zealand. Chapter 2 is about sampling design; Chapter 3 is about weighting system; Chapter 4 covers how to estimate sampling errors. Chapter 5 briefly introduces software for sampling. "],
["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Sampling is all about getting/taking a sample from a population. It is clear that a sample is just a subset of a population. At the end of day, what we are concerned about are data—population and sample both are data and they can be represented as tables. So, for a population, we can use the following table to represent/show it. Unit_ID \\(Y_1\\) \\(Y_2\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(Y_m\\) 1 2 \\(\\vdots\\) \\(N\\) The population shown in the above table has size \\(N\\), and we are interested in the \\(m\\) unknown variables, \\(Y_1\\, Y_2,\\ \\ldots,\\ Y_m\\). A part/portion of the above table is a sample. We make efforts to use the known sample (i.e. collected data) to get insights into the whole population—this is serious business. Sampling is challenging, because not only must we deal with mathematics but also we must cope with many practical issues, such as defining population, reducing cost (as much as we can), and non-response etc. etc.. Part I of this book is mathematics oriented, and Part II focuses on practical matters in sampling. "],

Unit_ID \\(Y\\) 1 6 2 8 3 8 4 1 5 6 6 4 7 7 8 5 9 3 10 3 The population size \\(N=10\\). Let us choose the sample size \\(n\\) be \\(3\\). There are \\({10 \\choose 3}=120\\) possible samples—here we are talking about simple random samples (SRS). In practice, we can only have one sample, and there will always be uncertainty if we use one sample to infer the whole population. The population mean \\(\\bar{Y}=5.1\\). The distribution of all possible sample means is shown below. The mean of the distribution is \\(5.1\\), which is the same as the population mean \\(\\bar{Y}\\). So, sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. The population variance is \\[ S^2=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2}{N-1}=5.43 \\] The distribution of all possible sample variances (NB: the divisor is \\(n-1\\)) is shown below. The mean of the distribution is 5.43, which is the same as the population variance. So, under simple random sampling, sample variance is an unbiased estimator of the population variance. "],
["sampling-design.html", "2 Sampling design 2.1 General ideas", " 2 Sampling design 2.1 General ideas Throughout this chapter, sampling design means probability sampling design. Following (but not strictly) Tillé and Wilhelm (2017), the settings are as follows: The universe is \\({\\cal U}=\\{1, 2, \\ldots, i, \\ldots, N\\}\\). A sample \\(S\\) is a subset of \\({\\cal U}\\). We restrict that \\(S\\) cannot be empty. There are \\(2^N-1\\) possible samples. Let the set of all the possible samples be denoted by \\(\\Omega\\). A sampling design specifies a probability distribution \\(p(\\cdot)\\) over \\(\\Omega\\) such that \\[ p(S)\\ge 0\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\sum_{S\\in \\Omega} p(S)=1. \\] Define \\[ \\pi_i = \\hbox{the probability of selecting unit}\\ i \\] and for \\(i\\neq j\\) \\[ \\pi_{ij} = \\hbox{the probability that both units}\\ i\\ \\hbox{and}\\ j\\ \\hbox{are selected in the sample.} \\] Then, \\[ \\pi_i = \\sum_{i \\in S}p(S)\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\pi_{ij}=\\sum_{\\{i,\\ j\\}\\subset S}p(S). \\] Examples of sampling designs: simple random sampling: \\[ p(S)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} {N \\choose n}^{-1}, &amp; \\hbox{if}\\ S\\in S_n,\\\\ 0, &amp; \\hbox{otherwise}, \\end{array} \\right. \\] where \\(S_n= \\{S\\in \\Omega|\\#S = n\\}\\) and \\(n\\) is the sample size. For this sampling design, \\[ \\pi_i = \\frac{n}{N}\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\pi_{ij}= \\frac{n(n-1)}{N(N-1)}. \\] Strafied sampling: \\[ p(S)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\prod_{h=1}^H{N_h \\choose n_h}^{-1}, &amp;\\hbox{if}\\ \\#(S\\bigcap {\\cal U}_h)=n_h\\ \\hbox{for}\\ h=1,\\ldots, H,\\\\ 0, &amp; \\hbox{otherwise}, \\end{array} \\right. \\] where the universe \\({\\cal U}\\) is partitioned into \\(H\\) strata and \\(\\# {\\cal U}_h= N_h\\) for \\(h=1, \\ldots, H\\); \\(n_h\\) is the sample size for stratum \\({\\cal U}_h\\).

In Stage 1, we take psus—SRS, and in Stage 2, we take individuals—SRS (firstly using stratification with age being the stratification variable). For each psu, we can know which region it belongs to, if it is urban or rural, if it has high/low Maori people, and based on the information we can partition all the psus into 50 strata (NB: this is after some necessary combination is done). Sample sizes: a) how many psus to be taken in each stratum; b) how many individuals to be taken from the selected psus.
