I guess that different answers will come up, because we are all different in many aspects, such as culture background, knowledge level, and learning style etc. etc.. For myself, if I want to seriously learn some complex stuff, then I will write about it. Without doubts, Sampling is complex, and it is kind of boring, but it is important, because I need it for my work at Stats NZâ€”since you are reading maybe it has importance for you as well but possibly with different reasons. So, I have to learn and re-learn sampling, and now I am writing about it. Since I work for Stats NZ, I will use contexts and examples at there. Chapter 1 introduces preliminary concepts, such as population, target population, survey populaton, simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling. Chapter 1 also presents the New Zealand knowledge required for sampling design. Chapter 2 is about sampling design; Chapter 3 is about weighting system; Chapter 4 covers how to estimate sampling errors. Chapter 4 briefly introduces sampling software. "],
