I guess that many different answers will come out, because we are all different in many aspects, such as culture background, knowledge level, and learning style etc. etc.. For myself, if I want to seriously learn some complex stuff, then I will write about it. Without doubts, Sampling is complex, and it is kind of boring, but it is important (for me, because I need it for my work, and for you the reasons must be different). So, I have to learn and re-learn sampling, and now I am writing about it. Since I live and work in New Zealand, I will use contexts and examples at there. Chapter 1 introduces preliminary concepts, such as population, target population, survey populaton, simple random sample, stratified sample, cluster sample, and systematic sample. Chapter 1 also presents some knowledge about New Zealand. Chapter 2 is about sampling design; Chapter 3 is about weighting system; Chapter 4 covers how to estimate sampling errors. Chapter 5 briefly introduces software for sampling. "],

["sampling-design.html", "2 Sampling design 2.1 General ideas 2.2 Sampling design for 2018 TK", " 2 Sampling design 2.1 General ideas Throughout this chapter, sampling design means probability sampling design. Following (but not strictly) Tillé and Wilhelm (2017), the settings are as follows: The universe is \\({\\cal U}=\\{1, 2, \\ldots, i, \\ldots, N\\}\\). A sample \\(S\\) is a subset of \\({\\cal U}\\). We restrict that \\(S\\) cannot be empty. There are \\(2^N-1\\) possible samples. Let the set of all the possible samples be denoted by \\(\\Omega\\). A sampling design specifies a probability distribution \\(p(\\cdot)\\) over \\(\\Omega\\) such that \\[ p(S)\\ge 0\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\sum_{S\\in \\Omega} p(S)=1. \\] Define \\[ \\pi_i = \\hbox{the probability of selecting unit}\\ i \\] and for \\(i\\neq j\\) \\[ \\pi_{ij} = \\hbox{the probability that both units}\\ i\\ \\hbox{and}\\ j\\ \\hbox{are selected in the sample.} \\] Then, \\[ \\pi_i = \\sum_{i \\in S}p(S)\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\pi_{ij}=\\sum_{\\{i,\\ j\\}\\subset S}p(S). \\] Examples of sampling designs: simple random sampling: \\[ p(S)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} {N \\choose n}^{-1}, &amp; \\hbox{if}\\ S\\in S_n,\\\\ 0, &amp; \\hbox{otherwise}, \\end{array} \\right. \\] where \\(S_n= \\{S\\in \\Omega|\\#S = n\\}\\) and \\(n\\) is the sample size. For this sampling design, \\[ \\pi_i = \\frac{n}{N}\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\pi_{ij}= \\frac{n(n-1)}{N(N-1)}. \\] Strafied sampling: \\[ p(S)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\prod_{h=1}^H{N_h \\choose n_h}^{-1}, &amp;\\hbox{if}\\ \\#(S\\bigcap {\\cal U}_h)=n_h\\ \\hbox{for}\\ h=1,\\ldots, H,\\\\ 0, &amp; \\hbox{otherwise}, \\end{array} \\right. \\] where the universe \\({\\cal U}\\) is partitioned into \\(H\\) strata and \\(\\# {\\cal U}_h= N_h\\) for \\(h=1, \\ldots, H\\); \\(n_h\\) is the sample size for stratum \\({\\cal U}_h\\). For this sampling design, \\[ \\pi_i = \\frac{n_h}{N_h},\\ \\hbox{if}\\ i\\in {\\cal U}_h, \\] and \\[ \\pi_{ij}=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{n_h(n_h-1)}{N_h(N_h-1)}, &amp; \\hbox{if}\\ i, j\\in {\\cal U}_h,\\\\ \\frac{n_gn_h}{N_gN_h}, &amp;\\hbox{if}\\ i \\in {\\cal U}_g,\\ j\\in {\\cal U}_h,\\ g\\neq h. \\end{array} \\right. \\] 2.2 Sampling design for 2018 TK Target population: the people who are NZ usual residents living in private dwellings aged 15 or above Maori (ethnicity or descent) Sampling frame: it’s formed by using the 2018 Census data (i.e. individual table and dwelling table) Sampling scheme: stratified two-stage sampling. In Stage 1, we take psus—SRS, and in Stage 2, we take individuals—SRS (firstly using stratification with age being the stratification variable). For each psu, we can know which region it belongs to, if it is urban or rural, if it has high/low Maori people, and based on the information we can partition all the psus into 50 strata (NB: this is after some necessary combination is done). Sample sizes: a) how many psus to be taken in each stratum; b) how many individuals to be taken from the selected psus. Notation: \\(N:\\) population size (or total number of ssus) \\(H:\\) total number of strata \\(N_h:\\) size of stratum \\(h\\), for \\(h=1, 2,\\ldots, H\\) \\(n:\\) sample size \\(n_h:\\) sample size of stratum \\(h\\), for \\(h=1, 2,\\ldots, H\\) \\(M:\\) number of psus \\(M_h:\\) number of psus in stratum \\(h\\), for \\(h=1, 2,\\ldots, H\\) \\(m_h:\\) number of psus to be taken from stratum \\(h\\), for \\(h=1, 2,\\ldots, H\\) \\(n_{ih}:\\) \\(n_h\\) is split into \\(n_{1h}\\), \\(n_{2h}\\) and \\(n_3h\\) in stage 2, where \\(i\\) indicates age group. Step 1: \\(n\\longrightarrow \\{n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_H\\}\\), for example \\[ n_h = \\text{ceiling}\\left(\\frac{nN_h}{\\sum_{h=1}^H N_h}\\right). \\] Step 2: find \\(m_h\\), for example \\[ m_h = \\text{ceiling}\\left(\\frac{n_h}{\\frac{N_h}{M_h}}\\right). \\] Note that \\(\\frac{N_h}{M_h}\\) is average size of psus in stratum \\(h\\). Step 3: \\(n_h\\longrightarrow \\{n_{1h}, n_{2h}, n_{3h}\\}\\), for example \\[ n_{ih} = n_h\\times f_i, \\] where \\(f_i\\) is sampling fraction for age group \\(i\\) (e.g. \\(f_1=f_2=0.35,\\ f_3=0.3\\).)
