I guess that many different answers will come up, because we are all different in many aspects, such as culture background, knowledge level, and learning style etc. etc.. For myself, if I want to seriously learn some complex stuff, then I will write about it. Without doubts, Sampling is complex, and it is kind of boring, but it is important (for me, because I need it for my work at Stats NZ, and for you the reasons must be different). So, I have to learn and re-learn sampling, and now I am writing about it. Since I work for Stats NZ, I will use contexts and examples at there. Chapter 1 introduces preliminary concepts, such as population, target population, survey populaton, simple random sample, stratified sample, cluster sample, and systematic sample. Chapter 1 also presents the knowledge about New Zealand, which is required for sampling design at Stats NZ. Chapter 2 is about sampling design; Chapter 3 is about weighting system; Chapter 4 covers how to estimate sampling errors. Chapter 4 briefly introduces software for sampling. "],
