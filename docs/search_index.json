I guess that many different answers will come out, because we are all different in many aspects, such as culture background, knowledge level, and learning style etc. etc.. For myself, if I want to seriously learn some complex stuff, then I will write about it. Without doubts, Sampling is complex, and it is kind of boring, but it is important (for me, because I need it for my work, and for you the reasons must be different). So, I have to learn and re-learn sampling, and now I am writing about it. Since I live and work in New Zealand, I will use contexts and examples at there. Chapter 1 introduces preliminary concepts, such as population, target population, survey populaton, simple random sample, stratified sample, cluster sample, and systematic sample. Chapter 1 also presents some knowledge about New Zealand. Chapter 2 is about sampling design; Chapter 3 is about weighting system; Chapter 4 covers how to estimate sampling errors. Chapter 5 briefly introduces software for sampling. "],

["sampling-design.html", "2 Sampling design 2.1 General ideas", " 2 Sampling design 2.1 General ideas Throughout this chapter, sampling design means probability sampling design. Following (but not strictly) Tillé and Wilhelm (2017), the settings are as follows: The universe is \\({\\cal U}=\\{1, 2, \\ldots, i, \\ldots, N\\}\\). A sample \\(S\\) is a subset of \\({\\cal U}\\). We restrict that \\(S\\) cannot be empty. There are \\(2^N-1\\) possible samples. Let the set of all the possible samples be denoted by \\(\\Omega\\). A sampling design specifies a probability distribution \\(p(\\cdot)\\) over \\(\\Omega\\) such that \\[ p(S)\\ge 0\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\sum_{S\\in \\Omega} p(S)=1. \\] Define \\[ \\pi_i = \\hbox{the probability of selecting unit}\\ i \\] and for \\(i\\neq j\\) \\[ \\pi_{ij} = \\hbox{the probability that both units}\\ i\\ \\hbox{and}\\ j\\ \\hbox{are selected in the sample.} \\] Then, \\[ \\pi_i = \\sum_{i \\in S}p(S)\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\pi_{ij}=\\sum_{\\{i,\\ j\\}\\subset S}p(S). \\] Examples of sampling designs: simple random sampling: \\[ p(S)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} {N \\choose n}^{-1}, &amp; \\hbox{if}\\ S\\in S_n,\\\\ 0, &amp; \\hbox{otherwise}, \\end{array} \\right. \\] where \\(S_n= \\{S\\in \\Omega|\\#S = n\\}\\) and \\(n\\) is the sample size. For this sampling design, \\[ \\pi_i = \\frac{n}{N}\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\pi_{ij}= \\frac{n(n-1)}{N(N-1)}. \\] Strafied sampling: \\[ p(S)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\prod_{h=1}^H{N_h \\choose n_h}^{-1}, &amp;\\hbox{if}\\ \\#(S\\bigcap {\\cal U}_h)=n_h\\ \\hbox{for}\\ h=1,\\ldots, H,\\\\ 0, &amp; \\hbox{otherwise}, \\end{array} \\right. \\] where the universe \\({\\cal U}\\) is partitioned into \\(H\\) strata and \\(\\# {\\cal U}_h= N_h\\) for \\(h=1, \\ldots, H\\); \\(n_h\\) is the sample size for stratum \\({\\cal U}_h\\). For this sampling design, \\[ \\pi_i = \\frac{n_h}{N_h},\\ \\hbox{if}\\ i\\in {\\cal U}_h, \\] and \\[ \\pi_{ij}=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{n_h(n_h-1)}{N_h(N_h-1)}, &amp; \\hbox{if}\\ i, j\\in {\\cal U}_h,\\\\ \\frac{n_gn_h}{N_gN_h}, &amp;\\hbox{if}\\ i \\in {\\cal U}_g,\\ j\\in {\\cal U}_h,\\ g\\neq h. \\end{array} \\right. \\] "],
