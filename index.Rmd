# Preface {-}

How do you learn, or to be exact, how do you learn complex stuff? I guess that different answers will come up, because we are all different in many aspects, such as culture background, knowledge level, and learning style etc. etc.. For myself, if I want to seriously learn some complex stuff, then I will write about it. Without doubts, *Sampling* is complex, and it is kind of boring, but it is important, because I need it for my work at Stats NZ (since you are reading maybe it has importance for you as well but possibly with different reasons). So, I have to learn and re-learn sampling, and now I am writing about it.

Since I work for Stats NZ, I will use contexts and examples at there. Chapter 1 introduces preliminary concepts, such as *population*, *target population*, *survey populaton*, *simple random sampling*, *stratified sampling*, *cluster sampling*, and *systematic sampling*. Chapter 1 also presents the New Zealand knowledge required for sampling design. Chapter 2 is about *sampling design*; Chapter 3 is about *weighting system*; Chapter 4 covers how to estimate *sampling errors*. Chapter 4 briefly introduces sampling software.
